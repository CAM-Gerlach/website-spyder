body:

Following our review of the project's recent progress in [Part 1](https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-status-2018-past/), and our major announcements about its current status in [Part 2](https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-status-2018-present/), we can finally get to the moment I'm sure a lot of you are looking forward to the mostâ€”the Spyder 4 development roadmap and release schedule.
Plus, we'll go over the development status and what to expect using each branch, a couple other longer-term projects concurrent with the Spyder 4 development cycle, and (most exciting of all), some (tentative) long-term plans beyond it. Strap in; let's get started.
